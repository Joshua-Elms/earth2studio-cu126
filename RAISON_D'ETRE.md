This fork of Earth2Studio (E2S) only exists as a fix for a problem installing E2S on Indiana University HPC resources. In particular, the pyproject.toml file in the repo has been modified to pull torch from the Cuda v12.6 wheel instead of the Cuda v12.8 wheel as in the default version. IU's Quartz machine currently only has cudatoolkit/12.6 and older, and the process to get new software is arduous, so for now I'll be installing E2S from this fork instead of the real one. It should be kept in sync with the upstream repo.
